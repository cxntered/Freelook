# `Freelook`

A Forge 1.8.9 mod that allows you freely look around without moving your head.

This mod is a remake of [`Perspective Mod V4`](https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/PerspectiveModv4) by DJtheRedstoner and blowsy's `Perspective Mod` ([video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ca5GCDY_1nw), [mod](https://bit.ly/freelookbypass)) in Kotlin and with mixins, and as such uses code from both mods.

## Disclaimer

Currently, this mod bypasses Hypixel by hiding its mod ID. As Hypixel was well in their right to blacklist Freelook, this mod is an unfair advantage and is theoretically bannable. However, in the future, I am planning to remove this bypass and instead implement Snaplook into the mod, which will be automatically & forcefully enabled when on Hypixel.
