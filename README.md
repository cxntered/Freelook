# `Freelook`

A Forge 1.8.9 mod that allows you freely look around without moving your head.

This mod is a remake of [`Perspective Mod V4`](https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/PerspectiveModv4) by DJtheRedstoner and blowsy's `Perspective Mod` ([video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ca5GCDY_1nw), [mod](https://bit.ly/freelookbypass)) in Kotlin and with mixins, and as such uses code from both mods.
